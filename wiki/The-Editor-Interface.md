# The Editor Interface

The editor (`index.html`) uses a classic RPG-maker layout: a **menu bar** along the top, an **icon
toolbar** with one-click actions, the **map canvas** in the middle, and palettes/lists around it.
This page is your map of the map-maker.

## The menu bar

| Menu | What lives there |
|---|---|
| **File** | New Project, Open/Save Project (`.json`), Export Standalone Game (`.exe`/`.html`) |
| **Edit** | Undo, Redo, Cut, Copy, Paste |
| **Mode** | Switch between **Map**, **Event**, **Passability**, and **Height** modes |
| **Draw** | Choose a drawing tool (Pen, Eraser, Rectangle, Circle, Fill, Shadow Pen) |
| **Layer** | Choose which layer you're painting (Auto, Ground, Decor, Decor 2, Overhead) |
| **Scale** | Zoom level for the canvas |
| **Tools** | The big managers: Database, Plugin Manager, Audio Manager, Event Searcher, Resource Manager, Character Generator |
| **Game** | Set Start Position, Playtest, and game-wide settings |
| **Help** | In-app help and reference |

The **icon toolbar** duplicates the most common actions so they're always one click away, including
the **▶ Playtest** button.

## The four modes

You're always in exactly one mode. Modes decide what clicking the map *does*.

| Mode | What you do | Key idea |
|---|---|---|
| **Map** | Paint tiles to build the world | Most of your time is spent here |
| **Event** | Double-click a cell to create/edit an event; drag events to move them | Where *things happen* — see [Events](Events) |
| **Passability** | See ○/✕ per tile; click to override (auto → block → pass) | Controls where the player can walk |
| **Height (HD-2D)** | Paint per-tile elevation; raised tiles extrude into 3D in HD-2D maps | Optional; see [Maps & Tiles](Maps-and-Tiles#hd-2d-heights) |

## Drawing tools (Map & Height modes)

| Tool | Shortcut | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Pen** | `B` | Paint one tile at a time (click and drag) |
| **Eraser** | `E` | Clear tiles |
| **Rectangle** | `R` | Drag a filled rectangle |
| **Circle** | `O` | Drag an ellipse |
| **Fill** | `F` | Flood-fill a connected area |
| **Shadow Pen** | `S` | Paint half-tile shadow quadrants (Map mode) |

In **Height mode**, keys `0`–`9` set the elevation value the tools paint.

---

## Layers

Maps are built from **four tile layers**, drawn bottom to top:

| Layer | Shortcut | Typical use |
|---|---|---|
| **Auto layer** | `0` | The smart default — sorts terrain vs. decoration automatically |
| **Layer 1 — Ground** | `1` | Grass, dirt, water, floors |
| **Layer 2 — Decor** | `2` | Bushes, rocks, furniture |
| **Layer 3 — Decor 2** | `3` | A second decoration layer for stacking |
| **Layer 4 — Overhead** | `4` | Draws *above* the player — treetops, roof edges, archways |

Beginners can stay on **Auto layer** almost always. Reach for explicit layers when you want fine
control over what stacks on what, or to use the Overhead layer for things the player walks behind.

## The big managers (Tools menu)

| Manager | What it's for |
|---|---|
| **Database** | The data behind your game — actors, classes, skills, items, enemies, system settings. See [The Database](The-Database) |
| **Plugin Manager** | Add or edit JavaScript plugins. See [Plugins](Plugins) |
| **Audio Manager** | Preview every procedural sound effect and music theme. See [Audio](Audio) |
| **Event Searcher** | Find message text, event names, or switch/variable usage across *all* maps |
| **Resource Manager** | Browse every generated tile/sprite/battler and export them as PNGs |
| **Character Generator** | Compose original walking sprites (skin/hair/outfit/style). See [Characters & Custom Assets](Characters-and-Custom-Assets) |

---

## Selecting, copying, and pasting regions

Hold **Shift** and drag in Map mode to select a rectangular region. The selection grabs **all four
tile layers plus shadows and heights**. Copy it (`Ctrl+C`) and paste (`Ctrl+V`) elsewhere — perfect
for repeating a building, a forest patch, or a room. Events can be copied and pasted too.
