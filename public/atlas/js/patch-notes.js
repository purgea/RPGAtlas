    title: "Smoother Movement",
    summary: "Reworked the play-test movement loop so walking is fluid and runs at a consistent speed on every display.",
    items: [
      "Removed the brief pause that occurred at each tile during grid movement, for both the player and NPCs.",
      "Game logic now runs on a fixed timestep, so movement speed is identical on 60 Hz, 120 Hz, and high-refresh screens (no more fast-forward on fast monitors).",
      "Added frame interpolation so motion stays smooth on high-refresh displays.",
      "Event 'Wait' and camera-zoom timing is now frame-rate independent, matching real time even when the frame rate dips.",

      "Select a command and use Ctrl+C / Ctrl+X / Ctrl+V (or the Copy/Cut/Paste buttons) in the Commands list.",
      "Paste works across events, so you can copy a command in one event and paste it into another.",
      "Container commands (If / Choices) copy with everything nested inside them.",

    items: [
      "Click and drag a command in the Commands list to move it anywhere in the event.",
      "Drag commands into or out of If/Choices branches, not just within a single list.",
